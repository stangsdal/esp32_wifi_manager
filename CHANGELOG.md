# Changelog

All notable changes to the ESP32 WiFi Manager component will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.1] - 2025-12-25

### 🐛 Critical Bugfix

This patch release fixes a critical initialization issue that caused `ESP_ERR_WIFI_NOT_INIT` errors.

### Fixed

- **WiFi Initialization**: `wifi_manager_create()` now automatically initializes the entire WiFi subsystem
  - Network interface (netif) initialization
  - Event loop creation
  - WiFi driver initialization
  - Event handler registration
- **Error Handling**: Added proper error checking with `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` handling for already-initialized components
- **NULL Checks**: Improved validation to prevent crashes if initialization fails

### Changed

- Users now only need to initialize NVS before calling `wifi_manager_create()`
- No manual WiFi initialization is required (handled automatically)
- Improved error messages for initialization failures

### Technical Details

The tzapu-style API (`wifi_manager_create()`) now includes all initialization steps that were previously in the legacy `wifi_manager_init()` function. This ensures that WiFi operations like `esp_wifi_set_mode()` don't fail with `ESP_ERR_WIFI_NOT_INIT` errors.

### Migration

If you were manually initializing WiFi components, you can now remove:
- `esp_netif_init()` calls
- `esp_event_loop_create_default()` calls
- `esp_wifi_init()` calls
- Event handler registrations

The WiFi Manager handles all of this automatically.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-21
